ran the visualization program for unsupervised features
features collapsing all over from 1 to 9 epochs..

reassign_interval was 9

ran the visualization program for unsupervised features

features collapsing every 3 epochs

cleaned the code to use a single model

Train set: Average loss: 0.6120, Accuracy: 48052/60000 (80%)
Test set: Average loss: 0.2610, Accuracy: 9224/10000 (92%)

applied batch norm
tried different batch sizes

didn't work out..
test accuracy still 92%


have to do:
- apply batch norm layers
- change batch size
